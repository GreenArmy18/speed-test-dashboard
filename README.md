**Speed Test ISP with db storage.**

I don't know about you about you but I really like monitoring my bandwidth. So, I've created this tool that allows for watching it over time. 

As configured, it will connect to speedtest.net and run a test every 15 minutes, on the quarter hours.

I'm also planning on putting a front end on it so that it can just feed a monitor from a rpi.
